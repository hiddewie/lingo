# Lingo

This web application is a single HTML page with some Javascript and CSS, inluding sounds.

You can view the deployed application [here](https://hiddewie.github.io/lingo/).

### Words

The words are defined in [`words.js`](words.js).

### Controls

Control the interface with:
- Letters `A` to `Z`: input for the letters on the screen
- *backspace*: remove a letter from the screen
- *enter*: input the word
- *space*: switch the active team
- `\`` (*backtick*): sound a buzzer and switch the active team
- `1`: start or stop the random letter timeout (this automatically gives letters during the 10 letter word).
- `2`: give 47 bonus points to the active team
